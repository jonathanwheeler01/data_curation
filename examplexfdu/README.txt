THese are some very sparse but hopefully demonstrative xfdu files for a fake dataset. Please don't make fun of my pic. 

Each directoy gets an xfdu document with the directory's name suffixed by xfdu, ie. fake_xfdu.xml. Likewise any other meta schema would follow
a similar pattern of file name, schema prefix i.e. image_mixx.xml.

TODO: do a better job at demonstrating the behavioral element class.
