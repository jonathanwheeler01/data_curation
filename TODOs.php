/**
 * This is just a fake class so that I can get the documentation parser to keep
 * track of general TODOs.
 * 
 * @todo Change all classes to reflect their prefix. ie change class names of
 * Dublin core from Creator, Subject to DCCreator, DCSubject to avoid naming collisions.
 * 
 * @todo Consider moving to namespaces. I resisted using it for now mostly because
 * its very new in PHP. However it would clean up the autoload and negate the todo above.
 * I'm also not sure how it would limit reuseability in other frameworks such as Drupal.s
 * 
 * @todo Try to figure out if namespaces will work with Interfaces as well as classes.
